# imin=0 No minimization
# nstlim=1000000 Number of MD-steps to be performed
# ntx=5  Coordinates and velocities will be read from either a NetCDF or a formatted (ASCII) coordinate file.
# dt=0.002 unit in psec, timestep  2fs
# irest=1 Restart the simulation, reading coordinates and velocities from a previously saved restart file.
# ntpr=500 Every ntpr steps, energy information will be printed in human-readable form to files "mdout" and "mdinfo".
# ntwx=500 Every ntwx steps, the coordinates will be written to the mdcrd file
# ntwr=500 Every ntwr steps during dynamics, the “restrt” file will be written
# iwrap=1, If iwrap = 1, the coordinates written to the restart and trajectory files will be "wrapped" into a primary box.
# temp0 Reference temperature at which the system is to be kept
# ntb=2 Use periodic boundary conditions with constant pressure
# ntp=1 Use the Berendsen barostat for constant pressure simulation
# ntt=3 Use Langevin dynamics with the collision frequency γ given by gamma_l
# ntc=2 Flag for SHAKE to perform bond length constraints; = 2 bonds involving hydrogen are constrained;
# ntf=2 Force evaluation; bond interactions involving H-atoms omitted (use with NTC=2)
# gamma_ln=2.0  gamma_ln Collision frequency in ps
# ntt=3 Use Langevin dynamics with the collision frequency γ given by gamma_l
# cut=8.0 the nonbonded cutoff, in Angstroms; the default is 8.0
# ew_type = 0 Standard use is to have EW_TYPE = 0 which turns on the particle mesh ewald (PME) method.
# skinnb = 2.0 Width of the nonbonded "skin". The direct sum nonbonded list is extended to cut + skinnb;Default is 2.0 Å.
# vdwmeth=1 A value of 0 includes no correction; the default value of 1 uses a continuum model correction for energy and pressure; required for OPC water model.
