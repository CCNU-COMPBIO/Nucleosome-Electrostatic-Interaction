# 10,000 steepest descent minimization and then for another 10,000 conjugate gradient minizations.
# imin=1 Flag to run minimization; Single point energy calculation
# ntx=1 X is read formatted with no initial velocity information
# irest=0; Do not restart the simulation; instead, run as a new simulation
# ntmin=1 For NCYC cycles the steepest descent method is used then conjugate gradient is switched on
# ncyc=10000  The method of minimization will be switched from steepest descent to conjugate gradient after NCYC cycles
# maxcyc=2000 The maximum number of cycles of minimization
# ntf=1 Force evaluation;complete interaction is calculated (default)
# ntpr=10 Frequency of printing of the energy and its components
# ntb=1 periodic boundaries; constant volume
# nsnb=10 Determines the frequency of nonbonded list updates; Default is 25.
# ntwx=100; Every ntwx steps, the coordinates will be written to the mdcrd file
# cut=10.0 the nonbonded cutoff, in Angstroms; the default is 8.0
# ew_type = 0 Standard use is to have EW_TYPE = 0 which turns on the particle mesh ewald (PME) method.
# skinnb = 2.0 Width of the nonbonded "skin". The direct sum nonbonded list is extended to cut + skinnb;Default is 2.0 Å.
