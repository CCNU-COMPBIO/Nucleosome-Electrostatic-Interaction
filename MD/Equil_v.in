# nmropt=1= 1 NMR restraints and weight changes will be read. For heating
# imin=0 No minimization
# nstlim=100000 Number of MD-steps to be performed
# ntx=1  X is read formatted with no initial velocity information 
# dt=0.002 timestep  2fs
# t=0, The time at the start
# irest=0 Do not restart the simulation;
# ntpr=500 Every ntpr steps, energy information will be printed in human-readable form to files "mdout" and "mdinfo".
# ntwx=5000 Every ntwx steps, the coordinates will be written to the mdcrd file
# ntwr=5000 Every ntwr steps during dynamics, the “restrt” file will be written
# iwrap=1, If iwrap = 1, the coordinates written to the restart and trajectory files will be "wrapped" into a primary box.
# tempi =100.0 Initial temperature
# temp0 Reference temperature at which the system is to be kept
# ntb=1 constant volume (default when igb and ntp are both 0, which are their defaults)
# ntp=0 No pressure scaling (Default)
# ntc=2 Flag for SHAKE to perform bond length constraints; = 2 bonds involving hydrogen are constrained;
# ntf=2 Force evaluation; bond interactions involving H-atoms omitted (use with NTC=2)
# gamma_ln Collision frequency in ps
# ntt=3 Use Langevin dynamics with the collision frequency γ given by gamma_l
# vdwmeth=1 A value of 0 includes no correction; the default value of 1 uses a continuum model correction for energy and pressure; required for OPC water model.
